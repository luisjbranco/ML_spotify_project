    "The music market has changed a lot in the last two decades. Consumers are no longer willing to spend so much money to listen to music. This development has made the market more unpredictable and vulnerable. Artists and music labels have had to look for new sources of income on the one hand, and on the other hand, they are more dependent on the success of their released songs.  Especially concerning the release of new albums, artists mostly face a sitation, in which only a couple of songs get very popular and listened by a lot of consumers. Despite to that, artists and songwriters still invest a lot of time and money into each song of an album, even though the return in terms of number of streams or amount of revenue per song varies a lot. Thats why it would be very helpful for music creators to know in advance on what the popularity of a song is dependend on and according to that, include certain attributes within the lyrics or the beat for example. It could allow the music industry for better planning and more security, because a higher popularity of a song is synonymous with a higher number of streams, which in the end results in higher revenues and more royalites for the artists themselves.

From this dataset, on the one hand, we just try to keep information, which can be helpful for our analysis part. Examples for this are the album_type or available markets. On the other hand, we can get rid of information, which certainly do not have any impact on our popularity, for instance \"external_urls\".\n",

It can either be the \"artist_id\" which is equal to the variable \"id\" from the artists dataset or taking the album_id as well as the artist_id, which can be found in the other datasources. Additionally, our target variable \"popularity\" is contained in this dataset. This table contains our main variables of interest for the tracks, however in order to complement the datsets we should use the track id in order to get more variables from the other tables. "
